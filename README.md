# quordle
An attempt to clone the game Wordle in C, I will owe 5 dollars to anyone who can explain to me what line #315  (the one that declares *\*answerPointer)*  does and why the program breaks without it.
  
the program uses the command `clear` to clear the terminal after each step on linux, substitue with `cls` for windows.
